The strength-to-weight ratio of Vista aluminium profile offers spectacular roof spans without the need for tie bars. No clunky bars or supports cluttering the ridge and no thick, chunky profiles dominating the glazing. With Vista you get strong, light and super slim aluminium roof profiles with exceptional thermal performance as well as stunning looks. The thermally broken aluminium rafters not only make this one of the most thermally efficient lanterns on the market it also reduces the visible width by up to 30% and the main feature ridge by up to 70% compared to competitors. These extra strong rafters mean the tie bars can be set higher, guaranteeing excellent headroom and no intrusion into the living area. Even in large buildings the roof structure remains remarkably minimal, creating a sense of clear, free space under the eaves. Our stock range of standard sizes come in a choice of colours, white, grey, black, grey and white or black and white and can be delivered within 10 days direct to site. Vista roof lights can be made to order in any size and any RAL colour and all aluminium exterior coloured profiles are quality finished with powder coat paint, which is guaranteed to last. A U-Value (W/m2K) is simply a measure of heat loss from a building structure â€“ for instance a roof, or a window and frame. A high U-Value means thermal insulation is poor whilst a low U-Value indicates a good thermal insulation. As a glazed roof is made up of both glass and rafters, you want low U-Values from both. High performance glass is usually rated at 1.1 or 1.2 U-Value, but the value of roof rafters vary considerably. The Vista rafter has a U-value of 1.5 W/m2k which is twice as thermally efficient as its nearest competitor (which are over 3). When using double glazed Low e glass (U-value 1.1W/m2k) the overall Vista roof has a U-value of as low as 1.2 W/m2k. The profiles in this range have been designed solely for roof glazing. This system can cope with varying degrees of roof pitch, from 3 to 45, and provides a complete thermally broken structure when complete. All Vista Glaze Roof lanterns come with a 10 year guarantee but The British Board of Agreement tested the roof system and have indicated that the roof will have a life expectancy of at least 25 years. 
Contemporary schemes often dictate minimal intrusion â€“ for instance to maximise open-plan layouts and create high roof spaces.

Vista Glaze Contemporary Lantern ROOFLIGHT1000 x 2000 White Int / Ext,"£2,023.56",Roof Lanterns,https://www.travisperkins.co.uk/roof-lanterns/vista-glaze-contemporary-lantern-rooflight1000-x-2000-white-int-ext/p/955970,https://dam-assets.apps.travisperkins.group/D3e6w/GPID_1000724347_IMG_00.jpg?width=300&height=300,"With Vista's Contemporary Lantern not only will you let more light in you can transform any roof into a stunning and modern architectural feature. The strength-to-weight ratio of Vista aluminium profile offers spectacular roof spans without the need for tie bars. No clunky bars or supports cluttering the ridge and no thick, chunky profiles dominating the glazing. With Vista you get strong, light and super slim aluminium roof profiles with exceptional thermal performance as well as stunning looks. The thermally broken aluminium rafters not only make this one of the most thermally efficient lanterns on the market it also reduces the visible width by up to 30% and the main feature ridge by up to 70% compared to competitors. These extra strong rafters mean the tie bars can be set higher, guaranteeing excellent headroom and no intrusion into the living area. Even in large buildings the roof structure remains remarkably minimal, creating a sense of clear, free space under the eaves. Our stock range of standard sizes come in a choice of colours, white, grey, black, grey and white or black and white and can be delivered within 10 days direct to site. Vista roof lights can be made to order in any size and any RAL colour and all aluminium exterior coloured profiles are quality finished with powder coat paint, which is guaranteed to last. A U-Value (W/m2K) is simply a measure of heat loss from a building structure – for instance a roof, or a window and frame. A high U-Value means thermal insulation is poor whilst a low U-Value indicates a good thermal insulation. As a glazed roof is made up of both glass and rafters, you want low U-Values from both. High performance glass is usually rated at 1.1 or 1.2 U-Value, but the value of roof rafters vary considerably. The Vista rafter has a U-value of 1.5 W/m2k which is twice as thermally efficient as its nearest competitor (which are over 3). When using double glazed Low e glass (U-value 1.1W/m2k) the overall Vista roof has a U-value of as low as 1.2 W/m2k. The profiles in this range have been designed solely for roof glazing. This system can cope with varying degrees of roof pitch, from 3 to 45, and provides a complete thermally broken structure when complete. All Vista Glazed Roof lanterns come with a 10 year guarantee but The British Board of Agreement tested the roof system and have indicated that the roof will have a life expectancy of at least 25 years.Slimmer, stronger and more thermally efficient with industry leading ridge and rafter U values. Ultra-low sightlines and contemporary design allows more light in the rafters are up to 70% slimmer than competitorsContact will be made with the customer to discuss final product details, before we complete the transaction, to make sure you have the right product for your project.Simple to install and fitter friendly ensuring fast high quality installations.Bespoke sizes and any RAL Colour also available to orderFast delivery direct to site with standard sizes and colours delivered in 10 days, flat packed for ease of lifting10 year manufacturers guaranteeDelivered direct from the manufacturer to your siteRooflights and Lanterns must be fitted on to a suitable upstand (not supplied).

As well as the double glazed double doors, there are 3 additional 3/4 length windows on the front with tilt and turn opening mechanisms that allow them to be opened conventionally or tilted back with the top of the window open. There are two more additional tilt and turn windows with one in each side wall. The doors can be positioned on the left or right side of the front aspect as the cabin is built. The walls are built using 45mm thick interlocking logs while the floor and roof are constructed from 19mm tongue and groove boards. All windows are double glazed with toughened glass. Overall dimensions are 6.24 metres x 4.66 metres (20 x 15 feet) and the front of the roof features a useful 60cm overhang to give some shelter from rain and to keep the worst of the rain off the front of the cabin.

It’s Tri-Lock™ thread forms, not cuts, a thread in the material expanding the wood which then relaxes back around the screw ensuring a tight and locked fix. Once driven in the screw will not move, it is secure for good - no stubbed toes!Spiral point for immediate start. No pilot hole requiredPermeated case with through hardening allows the perfect balance between core ductility and surface toughness with the strength of a high tensile bolt the screw will not snapPart thread eliminates jacking where a full threaded screw tends to pull apart the jointed materialCollar gives strength to the most vulnerable point of the screw, whilst allowing a deeper recess and less cam-out for a secure driveThree flats on the thread means that as the screw is driven there is less surface contact between the screw and timber allowing less battery wear, easier insertion and the screw will not work loose as the boards are walked uponNet-Coat® Green developed for new pressure treated timber and outdoor useView more"

Coupled with the rapid curing will in most applications reduce labour time by at least 50%.Phenomenal GrabNo need for any additional fixings as it was initially developed for facade bonding.Power Grab n Bond has a capacity to adhere to endless materials such as stone, granite, ytong, marble, concrete, wood, MDF, fibreglass, all metals (including alloys), glass, polystyrene, mirrors and most plastics (except PP, PE and PTFE).Power Grab n Bond’s ability to bond combined materials such as wood to concrete or stainless steel to stone is incredible.Power Grab n Bond was initially developed for façade applications, conventional methods relied on two component epoxy mix to adhere the marble or granite slab to the block wall. Depending on the weight of the slab each one would then have to be supported by drilling in ties to support each one. As with all epoxies they can be temperamental if the correct mix is not achieved. Also, full cure can be between 24 and 72 hours. Power Grab n Bond has none of these disadvantages.Reduce labour by 50%.View more"
