The strength-to-weight ratio of Vista aluminium profile offers spectacular roof spans without the need for tie bars. No clunky bars or supports cluttering the ridge and no thick, chunky profiles dominating the glazing. With Vista you get strong, light and super slim aluminium roof profiles with exceptional thermal performance as well as stunning looks. The thermally broken aluminium rafters not only make this one of the most thermally efficient lanterns on the market it also reduces the visible width by up to 30% and the main feature ridge by up to 70% compared to competitors. These extra strong rafters mean the tie bars can be set higher, guaranteeing excellent headroom and no intrusion into the living area. Even in large buildings the roof structure remains remarkably minimal, creating a sense of clear, free space under the eaves. Our stock range of standard sizes come in a choice of colours, white, grey, black, grey and white or black and white and can be delivered within 10 days direct to site. Vista roof lights can be made to order in any size and any RAL colour and all aluminium exterior coloured profiles are quality finished with powder coat paint, which is guaranteed to last. A U-Value (W/m2K) is simply a measure of heat loss from a building structure â€“ for instance a roof, or a window and frame. A high U-Value means thermal insulation is poor whilst a low U-Value indicates a good thermal insulation. As a glazed roof is made up of both glass and rafters, you want low U-Values from both. High performance glass is usually rated at 1.1 or 1.2 U-Value, but the value of roof rafters vary considerably. The Vista rafter has a U-value of 1.5 W/m2k which is twice as thermally efficient as its nearest competitor (which are over 3). When using double glazed Low e glass (U-value 1.1W/m2k) the overall Vista roof has a U-value of as low as 1.2 W/m2k. The profiles in this range have been designed solely for roof glazing. This system can cope with varying degrees of roof pitch, from 3 to 45, and provides a complete thermally broken structure when complete. All Vista Glaze Roof lanterns come with a 10 year guarantee but The British Board of Agreement tested the roof system and have indicated that the roof will have a life expectancy of at least 25 years. 
Contemporary schemes often dictate minimal intrusion â€“ for instance to maximise open-plan layouts and create high roof spaces.

The strength-to-weight ratio of Vista aluminium profile offers spectacular roof spans without the need for tie bars. No clunky bars or supports cluttering the ridge and no thick, chunky profiles dominating the glazing. With Vista you get strong, light and super slim aluminium roof profiles with exceptional thermal performance as well as stunning looks. The thermally broken aluminium rafters not only make this one of the most thermally efficient lanterns on the market it also reduces the visible width by up to 30% and the main feature ridge by up to 70% compared to competitors. These extra strong rafters mean the tie bars can be set higher, guaranteeing excellent headroom and no intrusion into the living area. Even in large buildings the roof structure remains remarkably minimal, creating a sense of clear, free space under the eaves. Our stock range of standard sizes come in a choice of colours, white, grey, black, grey and white or black and white and can be delivered within 10 days direct to site. Vista roof lights can be made to order in any size and any RAL colour and all aluminium exterior coloured profiles are quality finished with powder coat paint, which is guaranteed to last. A U-Value (W/m2K) is simply a measure of heat loss from a building structure – for instance a roof, or a window and frame. A high U-Value means thermal insulation is poor whilst a low U-Value indicates a good thermal insulation. As a glazed roof is made up of both glass and rafters, you want low U-Values from both. High performance glass is usually rated at 1.1 or 1.2 U-Value, but the value of roof rafters vary considerably. The Vista rafter has a U-value of 1.5 W/m2k which is twice as thermally efficient as its nearest competitor (which are over 3). When using double glazed Low e glass (U-value 1.1W/m2k) the overall Vista roof has a U-value of as low as 1.2 W/m2k. The profiles in this range have been designed solely for roof glazing. This system can cope with varying degrees of roof pitch, from 3 to 45, and provides a complete thermally broken structure when complete. All Vista Glazed Roof lanterns come with a 10 year guarantee but The British Board of Agreement tested the roof system and have indicated that the roof will have a life expectancy of at least 25 years.Slimmer, stronger and more thermally efficient with industry leading ridge and rafter U values.

It's built to a straight design with D-shaped vertical bars that contrast nicely with the cylindrical horizontal tubes. The high-quality steel has a powder-coated finish that stands up to corrosion in the moist environment of a bathroom as well as creating a smart look.  

The radiator works with central heating systems and can handle a maximum temperature of 110°C and a maximum pressure of 10 bar. Its heat output is calculated at Delta T50, the European testing standard for modern boilers. This makes it easy to calculate whether the heat output of the radiator is suitable for the space you need to heat.

This flat sheathed lead is used as fixed wiring in domestic and commercial premises, so it's perfect for jobs of all sizes. Coming in at 25m in length, it's long enough to be a popular choice with professional electricians and builders.

The twin and earth cable is encased in a durable PVC sheath that's highly resistant to general wear and tear, as well as being protective against dust and moisture. Inside, you'll find two insulated current-carrying conductors and one earth. You can easily strip the PVC sheath to wire it into place – just snip using a pair of wire strippers. The 1.5mm cable is BS6004-compliant, which means it's safe to use in low voltage power and lighting circuits.
