It measures 215 x 102.50 x 65mm (L x W x H) and weighs 2.33 kilograms. The product is manufactured from clay using a wire-cut process which involves higher firing temperature thus making it stronger and less porous. Owing to the friction and tension involved in the wire-cut process, it has a noticeable rough edge or finishes. However, the process is quicker and requires less material when compared to the pressed version process, which makes it more economical. The brick has low salt content which reduces moisture absorption to 7%, making the bricks ideal for damp proofing. It has the durability of F2 and active soluble salt of S2, both of which complies to EN 771-1. With a compressive strength of 75N/mm2, it is designed to resist greater lateral and vertical loads and last longer than ordinary bricks. The dense and strong semi-vitreous body allows the brick to withstand severe exposure to various weather conditions. It conforms to BES 6001 standard and can be used for interior and exterior requirements both commercially as well as domestically.
