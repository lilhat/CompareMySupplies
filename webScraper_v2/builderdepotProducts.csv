The core is MDF with a 0.5mm veneer on both sides to create the finished size. The veneer features an A grade face and a B grade face. Flat slicing produces a crown cut veneer which gives a more figured face. Solid timber and real wood veneers are natural products meaning each piece is unique with a variation in shading, colour, structure, grain and the inclusion of knots and fissures are characteristics of the product. Veneered MDF is an ideal alternative to solid woods and it is used for a number of purposes including making office furniture, kitchen cabinets, panel mouldings, dining sets, fire surrounds and many more. Due to its smooth and stable surfaces MDF is also used for decorative wood or laminate veneers and it can easily be drilled and cut to specific sizes.Key FeaturesEasy to fix with glues and screwsCan be cut to suit various shapes and formsEasy to sandTakes well to most adhesives, paints and veneersLight surface makes marking easy to seeApplicationVeneered MDF is suitable only for internal applications.

Being hardwood throughout (unlike some other plywoods available on the market) provides our plywood with consistent strength, stability and greater resistance to decay. Therefore making our plywood suitable for the many and varied applications for which it is used throughout not only the construction industry but many other areas as well. Key Features Pleasing B face with BB reverse suitable for clear finishing such as varnish Easy to work with both hand and machine tools Subtle colour variations may occur Strong and stable Technical Information Thickness: 18mm Length: 2440mm Width: 1220mm Pack Size: 50 Approvals EN 636-2 and EN314-2 compliant ApplicationHardwood plywood is not only used extensively throughout the construction industry but also in industries such as vehicle building and packaging. When suitably protected it may be used externally and will remain flat and stable throughout. The B face can be clear finished (using varnish/polyurethane) to highlight and enhance the attractive woodgrain surface. Grading InformationThis product is graded B/BB which is most commonly used in applications where the natural appearance of the wood grain is desirable. The B face is generally considered knot-free, however, due to its natural properties, minor imperfections may occur. The BB face is similar to the B face except slightly larger knots are permitted. Generally, the BB face will not be used for decorative/aesthetic purposes. It should also be noted that, due to the wood's natural properties, slight colour variations may occur. NoteWBP PLYWOOD (Weather and Boil Proof) This has become a somewhat ubiquitous and incorrect ''Trade term'' for some plywoods - which predates current statutory and building requirements and in fact only relates to the adhesive used to bond the individual wood veneers together during manufacture. For very many years now the term WBP has been superseded by EN13986 and for which EN636 defines the required performance or service classes for which the entire panel may be used (not just stipulating the glue which should be used).For more information to help with your purchase please see our what is hardwood plywood guide page.   18mm Hardwood B/BB Plywood (PDF)"

Being hardwood throughout (unlike some other plywoods available on the market) provides our plywood with consistent strength, stability and greater resistance to decay. Therefore making our plywood suitable for the many and varied applications for which it is used throughout not only the construction industry but many other areas as well. Key Features Pleasing B face with BB reverse suitable for clear finishing such as varnish Easy to work with both hand and machine tools Subtle colour variations may occur Strong and stable Technical Information Thickness: 25mm Length: 2440mm Width: 1220mm Pack Size: 36 Approvals EN 636-2 and EN314-2 compliant ApplicationHardwood plywood is not only used extensively throughout the construction industry but also in industries such as vehicle building and packaging. When suitably protected it may be used externally and will remain flat and stable throughout. The B face can be clear finished (using varnish/polyurethane) to highlight and enhance the attractive woodgrain surface. Grading InformationThis product is graded B/BB which is most commonly used in applications where the natural appearance of the wood grain is desirable. The B face is generally considered knot-free, however, due to its natural properties, minor imperfections may occur. The BB face is similar to the B face except slightly larger knots are permitted. Generally, the BB face will not be used for decorative/aesthetic purposes. It should also be noted that, due to the wood's natural properties, slight colour variations may occur. NoteWBP PLYWOOD (Weather and Boil Proof) This has become a somewhat ubiquitous and incorrect ''Trade term'' for some plywoods - which predates current statutory and building requirements and in fact only relates to the adhesive used to bond the individual wood veneers together during manufacture. For very many years now the term WBP has been superseded by EN13986 and for which EN636 defines the required performance or service classes for which the entire panel may be used (not just stipulating the glue which should be used).For more information to help with your purchase please see our what is hardwood plywood guide page."
