Excellent Night/Day Vision and HDR Technology: The interior facing camera with 4 infrared LED lights can handle low light conditions and ensure flawless video footage even when the passenger cabin is dark at night. Equipped with HDR technology, the front camera provides great exposure and dynamic range in low light conditions. ​
Compact Design and Wide-Angle Lens: A well-built compact body makes it ideal for discreet recording when you don't want individuals outside to notice your dash cam setup. The 170°wide angle front lens and 140°cabin lens capture the whole road in front of you from the edges of your windscreen and simultaneously record what is happening inside the cabin. ​
Loop Recording and G-sensor: Continuous loop recording will automatically overwrite the oldest footage, so you don't need to worry about your memory card running out of space. Combined with G-sensor (built-in acceleration collision sensor), the dash cam front and inside will lock the footage to prevent the video from being overwritten when it detects a sudden shake/collision, which can be used as evidence and insurance claims during car accidents.

The HYW130DC is a petrol-powered inverter welder generator from Hyundai, a specially designed inverter generator with a DC welder built-in. Our new Hyundai welder generator uses an AC welder for the AC output, so gives maximum AC power output and this also powers the DC inverter welder which produces the superior DC welding current. (Most welder generators use the main alternator to produce AC 115v/230v and also AC welding. This inferior design limits the AC output power and produces an inferior AC welding current). 2-In-1 Generator With In-Built DC Welder
This generator has DC welding capacity built-in, which provides a smoother output than that of AC. Large Fuel Tank
With a large 11.3L fuel tank, you won’t need to keep stopping to top up this welder generator with petrol, saving you time and hassle. Open Frame Petrol Generator
Weighing 61.75kg, the HYW130DC has a rugged open frame to protect it from bumps and knocks and is extremely easy to move around thanks to its built-in wheel kit. Multiple Sockets
This powerful welding genset is fitted with 1x 230v 13A & 1x 115v 16A sockets to ensure you always have multiple sockets available to power whatever is needed. Duty Cycle
This DC welder generator has a duty cycle of 35% at 100A. The easy-to-use control panel gives you maximum control over the required welding parameters and is also easy to use whilst wearing welding gloves. Powerful Multi-Tasking

Banana plugs help prevent corrosion and deterioration of existing speaker wire. Connection – The banana plugs will connect from 3mm up to 7mm diameter speaker wire. Dimensions – The overall length of the banana plug is 43mm and the pin is 13mm long. This is the standard size used for most speakers’ world wide. How to Use – Speaker cable can be connected easily through the side of the banana plug or through the top, using a screw mechanism. The plugs can be stacked with existing 4mm banana plugs. All the banana plugs are colour coded so you can attach the negative wire (black) to the black banana plug and the positive wire (red) to the red banana plug. Why Buy?
If you are using speaker cable directly connected your speakers, you will not get the best performance from them as the copper speaker cable will oxidize and corrode over time. By using a banana plug you can prevent this from happening. They are extremely easy to install and not only do they improve the sound quality, they allow you to quickly plug and unplug speaker cable into the terminals. To attach the plugs to the speaker wire, the speaker wire should be stripped, inserted into the banana plug and the screw tightened until secure. Most systems nowadays are jam-packed with cables running everywhere. It is usually very hard to properly insert speaker wire into terminals and to get them tight enough to hold the speaker wire in place.
