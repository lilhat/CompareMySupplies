The HY3150S is an electric air compressor from HyundaiDesigned for professional workshops and trade applications, the HY3150S air compressor is perfect for workshops and commercial garages for use for spray-painting, operating air tools and inflating tyres. Professional Use Compressor
Weighing 117kg, the HY30150S features four anti-vibration rubber feet. The 3hp electric motor can be powered by a standard 13amp UK 3-pin plug, making it ideal for a professional workshop or home garage use. 150 Litre Air Compressor
The large 150-litre tank capacity provides a constant 14cfm supply of air. Automatic Cut Out
The automatic pressure cut-out switch provides user safety with a built-in safety valve and pressure regulator with twin gauges, giving the user-controlled variable air pressure. This air compressor provides a fantastic combination of performance and durability ideal for professional applications in any workshop. Note on compressor care: Pressure safety valves on Hyundai air compressors have been updated in compliance with the latest CE certification standards. The pressure release pull ring has been removed from the safety valve to prevent it from being misused to drain the air from the compressor tank, causing excessive wear to the valve. Air and moisture should always be released daily using the drain valve located on the bottom of the tank. Check the belt tension and condition weekly and ensure there are no air leaks from hoses and fittings, as this will greatly increase the electricity used to maintain constant air pressure. 2.2kW/3hp Single Phase
The HY3200S compressors have a 2.2kw/2200w/3hp single phase, 230v 50hz electric motor. However, if the air compressor is being used for more than a 50% duty cycle (motor running for more than half the time) it may be advisable to use a blue 16 amp plug.
