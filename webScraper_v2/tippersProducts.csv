In contrast to building sand, sharp sand contains a greater proportion of larger particles which contributes to its gritty texture. Sharp sand is also a free-draining material due to the low silt and clay content. The use of sharp sand in concrete provides more strength and less flexibility than other types of sand such as, building, plastering and kiln dried sand. Sharp sand binds to the paving slabs while providing a surface which cushions the pavers, accommodates any variation in thickness between different slabs, and ensures that the finished surface is smooth and even.Sharp sand is ideal for using as part of the base underneath patios, artificial grass, driveways and block paving where a layer of MOT is used and then topped with a layer of sand and compacted for a level and smooth finish. A foundation of 40-50mm compacted sharp sand is required before laying your pavement. This bag contains a minimum weight of 850kg.

Mixing Instructions To overcome any potential segregation that has occurred during transit, thoroughly mix the maxi bag contents before use. The contents of the bag can be mechanically mixed in a free fall mixer for 3-4 minutes or hand mixed by pouring contents onto a clean, flat surface and slowly adding clean water in increments and mixing continuously until the desired workability is achieved. For optimum results, approximately 2.0 litres of clean water should be used per bag and mortar should be used within 60 minutes of water addition. Refrain from excessive water addition as this will weaken the mix, delay setting times and adversely affect durability. There is no need to add further additives or admixtures to the material on site as all required plasticizers/workability aids are already incorporated into the mix. Yield Each maxi bag of Remix Roof Tile Bedding Mortar will yield approximately 12 litres of fresh mortar when mixed with approximately 2.0 litres of clean water. "

In contrast to building sand, sharp sand contains a greater proportion of larger particles which contributes to its gritty texture. Sharp sand is also a free-draining material due to the low silt and clay content. The use of sharp sand in concrete provides more strength and less flexibility than other types of sand such as, building, plastering and kiln dried sand. Sharp sand binds to the paving slabs while providing a surface which cushions the pavers, accommodates any variation in thickness between different slabs, and ensures that the finished surface is smooth and even.  Sharp sand is ideal for using as part of the base underneath patios, artificial grass, driveways and block paving where a layer of MOT is used and then topped with a layer of sand and compacted for a level and smooth finish. A foundation of 40-50mm compacted sharp sand is required before laying your pavement.

The valve is designed to be fitted in the upper portion of the cylinder as this is where the hottest system temperatures will be found. If the system temperature rises beyond 95°C, the wax mixture within the element of the temperature probe will expand, causing the valve to lift off its seat and relieve water to waste. If the water pressure increases (without temperature increase) the valve will stay closed until the set pressure of the relief mechanism is reached, at which point the valve will open to relieve the excess pressure build-up.

This type of screw creates a tight friction fit between the threads to help prevent loosening caused by the vibration of drilling.
