For more than 5mm it should be left for 48 hoursSetcrete Latex is suitable to use over a wide range of absorbent sub floors which should first be coated with Setcrete Acrylic Primer diluted in a ratio of 1-part primer to 4 parts water.For non-absorbent sub floors, the surface should first be primed with un-diluted Setcrete Acrylic Primer to promote adhesionThe working time for use is approximately 15 - 20 minutes at 20°C, depending upon the sub floor absorbency, ambient temperature, and humidity. Do not mix more than one bag at a timeFor further information and technical advice regarding the use of Setcrete Latex, please email the Technical Services Department - contact@setcrete.co.ukView more"

There are two more additional tilt and turn windows with one in each side wall. The doors can be positioned on the left or right side of the front aspect as the cabin is built. The walls are built using 45mm thick interlocking logs while the floor and roof are constructed from 19mm tongue and groove boards. All windows are double glazed with toughened glass. Overall dimensions are 6.24 metres x 4.2 metres (20 x 14 feet) and roof features a useful 23cm overhang at the front and back and 20cm at the sides to give some shelter from rain. The internal floor dimensions of 5.7m x 3.7m give a total floor area of 21.2 mÂ² (228 square feet) which which makes this garden building a quick and cost-effective way of extending your living space significantly. Different roof felt options are available with this option being supplied with 34kg weight Polyester felt and black sand felt underlay. The felt has a polyester fibre base layer that makes it much stronger and more tear resistant than non-polyester grades. With more than three times the tear resistance of conventional mineral felt it has a life expectancy of up to 20 - 30 years when fitted correctly. All deliveries are made by vehicles with a crane off-load facility and with an optional professional assembly service. The log cabin must be built upon a solid and level surface such as a poured concrete base.6 metre wide log cabin with 228 square feet of floorspaceHigh specification includes 45mm thick log walls, toughened glass double glazing throughout, 5 tilt and turn windows and mortise locking double doors19mm Tongue & Groove roof and floor boardsGlazed double doors, three windows to the front plus two 3/4 length side windowsHigh quality, tear resistant, 34kg weight Polyester fibre backed felt with black sand felt underlaySupplied untreated and unpainted (a solvent-based preservative must be applied after assembly)View more"
