Zinsser Wallpaper Cover-Up - 2.5L,"Wallpaper Cover-Up is an all-in-one primer, sealer and stain blocker. A high hiding primer that obliterates wallpaper print with a smooth matt off-white finish. Can be used under any coloured emulsion. Wallpaper Cover Up can be applied by either brush or roller (for best results use a short pile mohair or microfibre roller)Unlike a regular emulsion which can cause wallpaper to bubble and blister, Wallpaper Cover Up seals the wallpaper protecting it from the moisture in the paint and once dry, this one-coat system creates a new surface thats easy to paint. Application - Stir thoroughly before use. Apply when temperature is between 10-30oC to ensure proper drying. Best results are achieved by roller application - Use a short pile (up to 5mm) mohair or microfibre roller.Apply evenly and avoid overspreading. If applying by brush, load generously and avoid overspreading. For very dark wallpapers or those which have a contrasting print, obliteration can be improved by using a wet on wet rollering technique. 15-30 minutes after application, roll over the applied surface again using a lightly loaded roller.Coverage - 5 - 8m2 per Litre. Uneven surfaces or a thicker coat will reduce coverage. Drying Times - Touch dry within 2 - 4 hours. Allow a minimum of 4 hours before over painting with a good quality wall paint.
