It measures 215 x 102.50 x 65mm (L x W x H) and weighs 2.33 kilograms. The product is manufactured from clay using a wire-cut process which involves higher firing temperature thus making it stronger and less porous. Owing to the friction and tension involved in the wire-cut process, it has a noticeable rough edge or finishes. However, the process is quicker and requires less material when compared to the pressed version process, which makes it more economical. The brick has low salt content which reduces moisture absorption to 7%, making the bricks ideal for damp proofing. It has the durability of F2 and active soluble salt of S2, both of which complies to EN 771-1. With a compressive strength of 75N/mm2, it is designed to resist greater lateral and vertical loads and last longer than ordinary bricks. The dense and strong semi-vitreous body allows the brick to withstand severe exposure to various weather conditions. It conforms to BES 6001 standard and can be used for interior and exterior requirements both commercially as well as domestically.

Concrete or screed surfaces must be fully cured, dry and any laitance removed. All holes, cracks or worn concrete should be patched with Sealocrete Sealoflor up to the level of the existing floor and allowed to set, before the main Cempolay Floor Levelling Compound is applied. Where deep holes or indentations are involved, Cempolay Floor Levelling Compound can be bulked out with clean sharp sand. Dense surfaces such as terrazzo and quarry tile, and also very porous surfaces, must be primed with a solution consisting of 1 part Cementone PVA to 5 parts water and allowed to dry before the Cempolay Floor Levelling Compound is laid. Floors treated with any type of surface dressing, must be tested to ascertain if there is any adverse effect on the bond of Cempolay Floor Levelling Compound.ApplicationThoroughly damp down or prime the floor as required. In hot conditions continue to keep the surface damp, but ensure free water does not remain on the surface. Pour the mixed Cempolay Floor Levelling Compound onto the substrate and spread to the required thickness using a float. Allow at least 16 hours to elapse, then ensure the Cempolay Floor Levelling Compound has hardened before applying the flooring adhesive. If application of the floor covering is delayed and especially in warm or drying weather, the floor should be damped down periodically.

Using underfloor heating with the correct insulation reduces running costs by up to 50% and reduces your carbon footprint. Most importantly it can reduce heat-up times to less than 30 minutes as opposed to 2+ hours without insulation. The boards are water resistant and offer sound reduction. Suitable for wet areas such as bathrooms and wet rooms but also ideal for kitchens, they are lightweight, easy to cut with a knife and install onto any surface. This insulation board can be fixed directly onto the surface without any prior preparation.  Ideal for wooden subfloor stability - when installing lay the boards and stagger the joints, use suitable tile adhesive, then fix with a screw fixing and washer at 200mm spacing.If you require technical advice or are undertaking a large project, please call 0208 838 8181 where experienced specialists are available to assist you Monday - Friday from 9.00 to 17.00 Key Features: Reduces heat-up times and running costs  High thermal insulation  Water resistant  Offers sound reduction  Excellent for bathrooms, wet rooms and kitchens  Lightweight  Withstands a load of 30 tonnes per square metre Technical Data: Thickness: 20mm  Width: 600mm  Length: 1250mm  Weight: 2.48kg  R value: 0.58 m2.K/W  Impact sound reduction dL = 21  Class ''0'' / ''B'' surface spread of flame  Consult our guide page for answers to questions like how much is underfloor heating? and how does underfloor heating work?",Builderdepot,building_supplies
