If your comparison website's niche is construction, there are several monetization strategies that could work well:

1) Affiliate marketing: Partner with construction-related companies such as tool manufacturers, home improvement retailers, and building supply companies and include affiliate links on your website. When a user clicks on one of these links and makes a purchase, you earn a commission.

2) Advertising: Sell advertising space on your website to companies in the construction industry such as architects, builders, and contractors.

3) Lead generation: Collect user information and sell it to businesses in the construction industry looking to acquire new customers.

4) Subscription-based services: Offer premium features such as detailed product comparisons, project management tools or contractor ratings and reviews for a subscription fee.

5) Direct sales: Offer construction-related products or services directly to users through your website, such as plans for DIY projects, or online courses on construction techniques.

6) Sponsored content: Create sponsored content for companies in the construction industry, such as a featured product or service spotlight, and include it on your website.

It's important to make sure that any monetization strategy you choose aligns with your website's mission and values and that it is transparent to your users.
