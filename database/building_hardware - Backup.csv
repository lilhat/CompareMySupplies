It measures 215 x 102.50 x 65mm (L x W x H) and weighs 2.33 kilograms. The product is manufactured from clay using a wire-cut process which involves higher firing temperature thus making it stronger and less porous. Owing to the friction and tension involved in the wire-cut process, it has a noticeable rough edge or finishes. However, the process is quicker and requires less material when compared to the pressed version process, which makes it more economical. The brick has low salt content which reduces moisture absorption to 7%, making the bricks ideal for damp proofing. It has the durability of F2 and active soluble salt of S2, both of which complies to EN 771-1. With a compressive strength of 75N/mm2, it is designed to resist greater lateral and vertical loads and last longer than ordinary bricks. The dense and strong semi-vitreous body allows the brick to withstand severe exposure to various weather conditions. It conforms to BES 6001 standard and can be used for interior and exterior requirements both commercially as well as domestically.

Laboratory testing has proven that Dryrod Damp-Proofing Rods out-perform competing treatment methods, even in highly-saturated walls and freezing temperatures. They have also been approved by the British Board of Agrement and the German WTA organization.
100% Active Ingredient for Maximum Water Repellency
It is not possible to infuse 100% pure active ingredient into a traditional Damp-Proofing Cream. Thanks to their unique fibre rods, Dryrod Damp-Proofing Rods are saturated with 100% silane/siloxane. Only the pure active ingredient diffuses into the wall, in a controlled dose that ensures consistent application. Cheaper creams may seem more attractive, but they often only contain around 25%-50% active ingredient. They cannot out-perform Dryrod.Guarantee - StatutoryFeatures and benefitsDryrod Damp-Proofing Rods are patented fibre rods that carry a powerful water-repellent material. They are simply inserted into holes drilled at regular intervals along a mortar course. Once inserted, the rods diffuse their water-repellent material along the mortar course, curing to form an effective barrier to rising damp.
