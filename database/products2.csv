The large 150-litre tank capacity provides a constant 14cfm supply of air. Automatic Cut Out
The automatic pressure cut-out switch provides user safety with a built-in safety valve and pressure regulator with twin gauges, giving the user-controlled variable air pressure. This air compressor provides a fantastic combination of performance and durability ideal for professional applications in any workshop. Note on compressor care: Pressure safety valves on Hyundai air compressors have been updated in compliance with the latest CE certification standards. The pressure release pull ring has been removed from the safety valve to prevent it from being misused to drain the air from the compressor tank, causing excessive wear to the valve. Air and moisture should always be released daily using the drain valve located on the bottom of the tank. Check the belt tension and condition weekly and ensure there are no air leaks from hoses and fittings, as this will greatly increase the electricity used to maintain constant air pressure. 2.2kW/3hp Single Phase
The HY3200S compressors have a 2.2kw/2200w/3hp single phase, 230v 50hz electric motor. However, if the air compressor is being used for more than a 50% duty cycle (motor running for more than half the time) it may be advisable to use a blue 16 amp plug.

Banana plugs help prevent corrosion and deterioration of existing speaker wire. Connection – The banana plugs will connect from 3mm up to 7mm diameter speaker wire. Dimensions – The overall length of the banana plug is 43mm and the pin is 13mm long. This is the standard size used for most speakers’ world wide. How to Use – Speaker cable can be connected easily through the side of the banana plug or through the top, using a screw mechanism. The plugs can be stacked with existing 4mm banana plugs. All the banana plugs are colour coded so you can attach the negative wire (black) to the black banana plug and the positive wire (red) to the red banana plug. Why Buy?
If you are using speaker cable directly connected your speakers, you will not get the best performance from them as the copper speaker cable will oxidize and corrode over time. By using a banana plug you can prevent this from happening. They are extremely easy to install and not only do they improve the sound quality, they allow you to quickly plug and unplug speaker cable into the terminals. To attach the plugs to the speaker wire, the speaker wire should be stripped, inserted into the banana plug and the screw tightened until secure. Most systems nowadays are jam-packed with cables running everywhere. It is usually very hard to properly insert speaker wire into terminals and to get them tight enough to hold the speaker wire in place.

25% more power – Brushless motors have fewer moving parts results in a quiet motor that never needs maintenance. The reduced friction enables a better use of available energy from the battery pack as there is no resistance from brushes
50% more run time – Brushless motor technology means the carbon brush resistance is eliminated, so less battery energy is wasted. The efficiency of a brushless motor results in a greater run time from each charge

The side frames are steel with a smooth melamine faced MDF table across the top.

The three clamps supplied as standard will hold the workpiece securely down against the table and up against the cutter leaving the operator to merely feed the timber through from right to left.

This covers all 1/4″ shank routers and even some 1/2″ shank routers can be used. The height under the table is 260mm.

The edges of conventional tarps are usually sewn together and then cut to make room for metal eyelets.

The edges of Yuzet tarpaulins on the other hand are folded over and then fusion welded which creates significantly stronger seams and a 100% waterproof fabric. The eyelets are ultrasonically welded, so there is no damage to the fabric and even under strain the material around the eyelets will not tear or break. Yuzet tarpaulins offer UV protection for the entire lifespan of the product. UV filters and stabilisers are integrated into the material before the tarpaulins are produced. This means that the tarpaulins can be exposed to harsh weather conditions and still be UV- resistant in bright sunshine.
