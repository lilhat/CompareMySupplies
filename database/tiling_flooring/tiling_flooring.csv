Apply the prepared Keraquick to the substrate with a notched trowel to a maximum of 10 mm thick. To achieve good adhesion to the substrate, first apply a skim coat of adhesive over the substrate using the flat edge of the trowel followed by combing through with the notched edge of the trowel to the required thickness. Ensure that a trowel with a notch size and profile appropriate to the size of tile is used. For demanding applications such as exterior tiling subject to freezing, swimming pools or water feature installations, heavy duty areas, floor tiling to be ground in situ, when installing tiles with deep recesses or lugs on the rear and for fixing large format tiles (> 300 x 300 mm), the adhesive should also be applied to the rear of the tile (back buttering).",Builderdepot,tiling_tools

Preferably using a mechanical stirrer. Use within 15-20 minutes, after which it will begin to set. A 20kg bag of Rapid Set should be mixed with 3.8-4.2 litres of water. Allow the mix to stand for a few minutes, then mix again briefly before applying. Do not wet tiles before fixing, if very dusty they may be wiped with a damp sponge. Rapid Set's open time in normal conditions is approximately 10 minutes, strong sun, drying wind, high temperatures or highly absorbent surfaces may drastically reduce this to a few minutes, therefore constant checks must be made to ensure no skin has formed and the adhesive is fresh to the touch. If a skin has formed adhesive should be removed and re-applied. Do not add water when adhesive has started to set. Adjustment of tiles, if necessary, should be made within 5-10 minutes. The tiles installed with Rapid Set should not be exposed to rain for at least 3 hours. Protect from frost and strong sunlight for 24 hours.",Builderdepot,tiling_tools
