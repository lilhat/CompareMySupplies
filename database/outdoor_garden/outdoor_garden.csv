A Keter shed provides ample airflow by having specifically placed vents but, as with any shed, condensation can form. If you do see signs of condensation here’s Keter’s handy hints to help you to protect your sheds contents. To prevent condensation inside your shed is to, wherever possible, not allow any excess moisture inside the shed. To do this try and ensure all equipment inside the shed such as camping gear or sporting goods are cleaned and dried before storing them in the shed. Try to let as much air inside the shed on cooler, dry days, by opening the shed doors. This will help the air circulation inside the shed and will drop the humidity level inside. Please note the durable material that all Keter sheds are made of will not be affected by the moisture or condensation as part of the Keter no maintenance promise.The Darwin shed is a 6 x 4ft shed with the look of wood but the durability of plastic The elegant 'wood effect' tongue & groove panels ensures the Darwin is quick & easy to assemble, no specialist tools required A floor panel is included to protect shed contents from mud & water Includes a window and ventilation panel to allow for natural light and adequate ventilation avoiding the build up of condensation Handle & lock hasp included to secure your belongings season after season (lock sold separately) Constructed from Evotech™ composite, a new & advanced composite technology that ensures a weather resistant and maintenance free shed that’s built to last Ideal for storing items such as BBQs, garden furniture or tools Comes complete with a 10 year warranty (covers product failure resulting from defects in manufacturing or materials for a period of 10 years from the date of original retail purchase.

We manufacture all of our Garden Buildings on site at our modern manufacturing unit based in the West Midlands. Our Sheds and other garden products are supplied flat-packed with all the necessary parts and fixings required for assembly.
Our Garden Buildings include Garden Sheds, Garden Storage, Bike Sheds and Log Stores. We offer a huge range of sizes and designs to meet every customer's needs.
This garden shed is built using quality tanalised pressure treated 12mm tongue and groove shiplap. The shiplap provides the extra protection and build quality that sub-standard over lap cladding can't.

The framing of the shed is 28x44 mm rounded and planed timber, which is far more sturdy and robust than most sheds. Each panel of the shed is fully framed and the shiplap cladding is double nailed for extra rigidity.

The roof and floor are made from 11mm sheet material. This board provides good strength, is moisture resistant and won't split. The floor is held off the ground with solid 28x38mm timber bearers, which provide a solid base. And the roof is waterproofed with 25kg green mineral felt.

The door provides good width for ease of access for larger items and is also built from same great quality 12mm shiplap and 28x44mm planed timber. The door is fastened with a turn button.

All our sheds and garden buildings are simple to construct and come with full and easy to read instructions and all the fixtures and fittings required.Assembly requiredFittings & fixings includedFloor includedFeatures and benefitsLong Lasting-Pressure treated timber is guaranteed to last for many years to come, you have no need to replace this wood frequently, due to its strength and resistance to fungal decay and insect damage. Save forest resources- Pressure-treated wood is natural, environmentally friendly, and safe; because of its longevity, there is reduced strain on the forest as there is less need for deforestation. Economical- Compare to pressure-treated wood with other traditional redwood, pressure-treated wood price is more affordability, especially for those who have a tight budget. Low-Maintenance-Pressure treated wood is impervious to pests, termites, and water, which makes the wood resistant to rot and water damage, therefore requires less maintenance.Tongue and groove means that each board has a tongue at the top and a groove at the bottom. This tongue and groove allow each board to be locked into the board directly above and below. Due to this interlocking action, our sheds last much longer and are far stronger than an overlap shed. Our cladding also comprises a feature known as shiplap. Shiplap cladding has the additional feature of a small profile at the top of each board. This allows water to run off the shed more quickly reducing the risk of water ingress.We use 28x44mm timber which has all 4 corners rounded and planed which provides a smooth, splinter-free professional finish to the interior of the shed.  Once the panels are screwed and joined together this creates heavy-duty framing.This garden building is supplied with a 20kg waterproof roofing felt. The felt is both durable and won't tear or ripple easily. The roofing felt is easy to fit,  simply roll it on and tack it down.",BQ,garden_buildings_storage

The LED ceiling light with precise detection. The four infrared sensors can be mechanically adjusted in each direction from 2 to 8 m to suit any need. 360° all-round detection is ideally suited for optimum adjustment to the local situation, e.g. carports and porches. The light diffuser also acts as the sensor lens - a patented world first. The ceiling light provides 1000 lm of illumination at an output of 9,8 W and can be mounted at heights of up to 6 m, including a convenient night light function (10%) at twilight.

Up to 80% energy saving
The savings apply in comparison to using a conventional LED light without motion detector with the same power for an average of 10 hours of continuous light a day.

The LED ceiling light with precise detection. The four infrared sensors can be mechanically adjusted in each direction from 2 to 8 m to suit any need. 360° all-round detection is ideally suited for optimum adjustment to the local situation, e.g. carports and porches. The light diffuser also acts as the sensor lens - a patented world first. The ceiling light provides 1000 lm of illumination at an output of 9,8 W and can be mounted at heights of up to 6 m, including a convenient night light function (10%) at twilight.

Up to 80% energy saving
The savings apply in comparison to using a conventional LED light without motion detector with the same power for an average of 10 hours of continuous light a day.
