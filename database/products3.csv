The automatic pressure cut-out switch provides user safety with a built-in safety valve and pressure regulator with twin gauges, giving the user-controlled variable air pressure. This air compressor provides a fantastic combination of performance and durability ideal for professional applications in any workshop. Note on compressor care: Pressure safety valves on Hyundai air compressors have been updated in compliance with the latest CE certification standards. The pressure release pull ring has been removed from the safety valve to prevent it from being misused to drain the air from the compressor tank, causing excessive wear to the valve. Air and moisture should always be released daily using the drain valve located on the bottom of the tank. Check the belt tension and condition weekly and ensure there are no air leaks from hoses and fittings, as this will greatly increase the electricity used to maintain constant air pressure. 2.2kW/3hp Single Phase

As soon as an outage is detected the ATS will restore power to your electrical items almost instantly for minimal downtime. What’s more, the ATS continuously monitors your main power supply to identify when mains power is restored and turns the generator off, saving you time and over-all running costs. With an electric key start option, you can also easily stop or start the generators manually should you wish to do so. A generous 20L fuel tank provides sufficient power for up to 16 ½ hours at around 50% load making them suitable for use in a wide range of environments such as domestic, construction and industrial. With a maximum output of 6.5kVA, these high-performance generators can power multiple devices at any one time. The silenced nature of these generators is down to the closed frame design which reduces sound output to a minimum, just 72 dB at 7m, for a more pleasant experience when in use. In the event of oil pressure becoming too low, the generator will automatically switch off to protect the powerful 13HP engine from potential damage.

Banana plugs help prevent corrosion and deterioration of existing speaker wire. Connection – The banana plugs will connect from 3mm up to 7mm diameter speaker wire. Dimensions – The overall length of the banana plug is 43mm and the pin is 13mm long. This is the standard size used for most speakers’ world wide. How to Use – Speaker cable can be connected easily through the side of the banana plug or through the top, using a screw mechanism. The plugs can be stacked with existing 4mm banana plugs. All the banana plugs are colour coded so you can attach the negative wire (black) to the black banana plug and the positive wire (red) to the red banana plug. Why Buy?
If you are using speaker cable directly connected your speakers, you will not get the best performance from them as the copper speaker cable will oxidize and corrode over time. By using a banana plug you can prevent this from happening. They are extremely easy to install and not only do they improve the sound quality, they allow you to quickly plug and unplug speaker cable into the terminals. To attach the plugs to the speaker wire, the speaker wire should be stripped, inserted into the banana plug and the screw tightened until secure. Most systems nowadays are jam-packed with cables running everywhere. It is usually very hard to properly insert speaker wire into terminals and to get them tight enough to hold the speaker wire in place.

A router table will convert a hand held plunging router into a stationary tool which is safer to use and quicker to set up than using freehand. Ideally suited for all 1/4″ sized routers (Those which use router bits with a ¼” diameter shank), this compact router table will perform a variety of jobs such as edge moulding, trenching and cutting tenons. The side frames are steel with a smooth melamine faced MDF table across the top. The insert plate, which must be drilled to suit your routers fixing points, is made from a tough plastic with an aperture in the centre for the cutter. The three clamps supplied as standard will hold the workpiece securely down against the table and up against the cutter leaving the operator to merely feed the timber through from right to left. Suitable for use with router cutters up to 35mm diameter. The table can be used with any router which has a faceplate diameter of up to 190mm. This covers all 1/4″ shank routers and even some 1/2″ shank routers can be used. The height under the table is 260mm. If your router is taller than this, you will need to make 2 runners to go underneath the side legs to lift the table up, to accommodate the extra height.

The edges of conventional tarps are usually sewn together and then cut to make room for metal eyelets. This weakens the material and as a result the tarpaulins can tear easily around the edges and eyelets. The edges of Yuzet tarpaulins on the other hand are folded over and then fusion welded which creates significantly stronger seams and a 100% waterproof fabric. The eyelets are ultrasonically welded, so there is no damage to the fabric and even under strain the material around the eyelets will not tear or break. Yuzet tarpaulins offer UV protection for the entire lifespan of the product. UV filters and stabilisers are integrated into the material before the tarpaulins are produced. This means that the tarpaulins can be exposed to harsh weather conditions and still be UV- resistant in bright sunshine. Superior to conventional tarpaulin and can be used for a wide range of applications.
