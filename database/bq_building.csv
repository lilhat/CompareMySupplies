Traditional rising damp treatment methods utilise cream or liquid injection. These methods can be prone to operator error leading to under-treatment and DPC failure. Due to their unique patented design, Dryrod Damp-Proofing Rods deliver the correct dose of active ingredient every time.
Extensively Tested and Internationally Approved
Laboratory testing has proven that Dryrod Damp-Proofing Rods out-perform competing treatment methods, even in highly-saturated walls and freezing temperatures. They have also been approved by the British Board of Agrement and the German WTA organization.
100% Active Ingredient for Maximum Water Repellency
It is not possible to infuse 100% pure active ingredient into a traditional Damp-Proofing Cream. Thanks to their unique fibre rods, Dryrod Damp-Proofing Rods are saturated with 100% silane/siloxane.
