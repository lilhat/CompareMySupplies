It measures 215 x 102.50 x 65mm (L x W x H) and weighs 2.33 kilograms. The product is manufactured from clay using a wire-cut process which involves higher firing temperature thus making it stronger and less porous. Owing to the friction and tension involved in the wire-cut process, it has a noticeable rough edge or finishes. However, the process is quicker and requires less material when compared to the pressed version process, which makes it more economical. The brick has low salt content which reduces moisture absorption to 7%, making the bricks ideal for damp proofing. It has the durability of F2 and active soluble salt of S2, both of which complies to EN 771-1. With a compressive strength of 75N/mm2, it is designed to resist greater lateral and vertical loads and last longer than ordinary bricks. The dense and strong semi-vitreous body allows the brick to withstand severe exposure to various weather conditions. It conforms to BES 6001 standard and can be used for interior and exterior requirements both commercially as well as domestically.

When mixed with water it produces a fluid, easily levelled compound with good adhesive properties, which will harden rapidly to form an ideal base for subsequent floor coverings.Key featuresSets hard in about 2-4 hours and normally floor coverings can be laid in 16 hoursEasy to mix and applyGives a self smoothing surfaceRapid curingPreparationCempolay Floor Levelling Compound must be applied to a surface which is sound and free from oil, grease, bitumen, plaster deposits, dust etc. and not subject to rising damp. Concrete or screed surfaces must be fully cured, dry and any laitance removed. All holes, cracks or worn concrete should be patched with Sealocrete Sealoflor up to the level of the existing floor and allowed to set, before the main Cempolay Floor Levelling Compound is applied. Where deep holes or indentations are involved, Cempolay Floor Levelling Compound can be bulked out with clean sharp sand. Dense surfaces such as terrazzo and quarry tile, and also very porous surfaces, must be primed with a solution consisting of 1 part Cementone PVA to 5 parts water and allowed to dry before the Cempolay Floor Levelling Compound is laid. Floors treated with any type of surface dressing, must be tested to ascertain if there is any adverse effect on the bond of Cempolay Floor Levelling Compound.ApplicationThoroughly damp down or prime the floor as required. In hot conditions continue to keep the surface damp, but ensure free water does not remain on the surface. Pour the mixed Cempolay Floor Levelling Compound onto the substrate and spread to the required thickness using a float. Allow at least 16 hours to elapse, then ensure the Cempolay Floor Levelling Compound has hardened before applying the flooring adhesive. If application of the floor covering is delayed and especially in warm or drying weather, the floor should be damped down periodically.

Generally, adequate curing is achieved by protecting the material from adverse weather conditions until fully hardened and thereafter allowing to dry slowly over several days.The final finish quality of this material will depend upon the operative having the required skills and a familiarity with the material and its application methods.Normal site practice to the relevant British and European Standards should always apply - Tarmac Cement UK cannot be held responsible where workmanship has not been carried out in accordance with good practice.
