A router table will convert a hand held plunging router into a stationary tool which is safer to use and quicker to set up than using freehand. Ideally suited for all 1/4″ sized routers (Those which use router bits with a ¼” diameter shank), this compact router table will perform a variety of jobs such as edge moulding, trenching and cutting tenons. The side frames are steel with a smooth melamine faced MDF table across the top. The insert plate, which must be drilled to suit your routers fixing points, is made from a tough plastic with an aperture in the centre for the cutter. The fence arrangement is simple and effective. The three clamps supplied as standard will hold the workpiece securely down against the table and up against the cutter leaving the operator to merely feed the timber through from right to left. A transparent guard protects the operator from flying chips and a dust chute is included for connecting to a vacuum or extractor. A sliding mitre fence, with a replaceable wooden face, completes the standard equipment. Suitable for use with router cutters up to 35mm diameter. The table can be used with any router which has a faceplate diameter of up to 190mm. This covers all 1/4″ shank routers and even some 1/2″ shank routers can be used. The height under the table is 260mm. If your router is taller than this, you will need to make 2 runners to go underneath the side legs to lift the table up, to accommodate the extra height. Supplied with tough plastic insert plate, adjustable fence with two replaceable wooden faces, horizontal feather board, two vertical clamps and sliding mitre fence.
