The exquisite craftsmanship can serve you well without breaking easily. This is a very practical gasoline siphon hose.

A siphon tube can easily pump oil from one container to another and can enter the tank without an anti-siphon filter.

The petrol siphon hose can get into tight spaces. The siphon is nice and thick so it won't break/crushed easily.

Gas siphons are stealing a little gas for the lawnmower when you need them, you just push the tube down and the fuel starts to flow, the same way as the old straws, but it's much safer.

Make sure to put the long hose into the liquid you want to pump and place the short hose on the end of the rubber ball that you want to pump.
