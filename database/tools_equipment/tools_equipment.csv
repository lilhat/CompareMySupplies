Operating at a maximum of 75dB and standing on anti-vibration mounts, this product is ideal for the home, workshop or garage use, or anywhere where there are conventional residential power sockets available.Guarantee - 2 yearsComes with a User ManualFeatures and benefitsAutomatic Cut Out
The automatic pressure cut-out switch provides user safety with a built-in safety valve and pressure regulator with twin gauges, giving the user-controlled variable air pressure.

This air compressor provides a fantastic combination of performance and durability ideal for professional applications in any workshop.

Note on compressor care: Pressure safety valves on Hyundai air compressors have been updated in compliance with the latest CE certification standards. The pressure release pull ring has been removed from the safety valve to prevent it from being misused to drain the air from the compressor tank, causing excessive wear to the valve.

Air and moisture should always be released daily using the drain valve located on the bottom of the tank.

Check the belt tension and condition weekly and ensure there are no air leaks from hoses and fittings, as this will greatly increase the electricity used to maintain constant air pressure.

The edges of conventional tarps are usually sewn together and then cut to make room for metal eyelets. This weakens the material and as a result the tarpaulins can tear easily around the edges and eyelets. The edges of Yuzet tarpaulins on the other hand are folded over and then fusion welded which creates significantly stronger seams and a 100% waterproof fabric. The eyelets are ultrasonically welded, so there is no damage to the fabric and even under strain the material around the eyelets will not tear or break.
Yuzet tarpaulins offer UV protection for the entire lifespan of the product. UV filters and stabilisers are integrated into the material before the tarpaulins are produced. This means that the tarpaulins can be exposed to harsh weather conditions and still be UV- resistant in bright sunshine. Conventional tarpaulins usually have a UV resistant substance sprayed on after production which can easily ‘washed off’ in bad weather resulting in a short lifespan of the product.Guarantee - StatutoryWaterproofFeatures and benefitsSuperior to conventional tarpaulin and can be used for a wide range of applicationsYuzet tarpaulins are folded over and then fusion welded which creates significantly stronger seamsThe eyelets are ultrasonically welded, so there is no damage to the fabric100% waterproof fabric",BQ,equipment

A cut of up to 3mm deep can be made, when more than 3mm needs to be removed, simply make multiple passes. When not in use both the infeed and outfeed tables fold up to make a more compact unit for convenient storage, there are also built-in carrying handles.

The thicknessing height is quickly set using a large adjusting handle and reading from a scale marked in both metric and imperial measurements. The timber is fed through the cutting knives by two rubber coated drive rollers leaving a smooth unmarked finish. A cut of up to 3mm deep can be made, when more than 3mm needs to be removed, simply make multiple passes. When not in use both the infeed and outfeed tables fold up to make a more compact unit for convenient storage, there are also built-in carrying handles. A nice feature, is the addition of 2 chromed rollers on top of the machine which allow the operator to pass longer lengths of timber back to the start position. Supplied with floor stand, carrying handles, rubber feet, blade setting tool, 50mm diameter extraction outlet, 2.5m power cable and UK 3 pin plug. It is essential to use dust extraction with a planer thicknesser. The extractor removes all the dust and chips which will otherwise build up, causing a blockage and eventually damage to the machine. Using an extractor also increases the life of the knives.

A siphon tube can easily pump oil from one container to another and can enter the tank without an anti-siphon filter.

The petrol siphon hose can get into tight spaces. The siphon is nice and thick so it won't break/crushed easily.

Gas siphons are stealing a little gas for the lawnmower when you need them, you just push the tube down and the fuel starts to flow, the same way as the old straws, but it's much safer.

Make sure to put the long hose into the liquid you want to pump and place the short hose on the end of the rubber ball that you want to pump.

The thicknessing height is quickly set using a large adjusting handle and reading from a scale marked in both metric and imperial measurements. The timber is fed through the cutting knives by two rubber coated drive rollers leaving a smooth unmarked finish. A cut of up to 3mm deep can be made, when more than 3mm needs to be removed, simply make multiple passes. When not in use both the infeed and outfeed tables fold up to make a more compact unit for convenient storage, there are also built-in carrying handles. A nice feature, is the addition of 2 chromed rollers on top of the machine which allow the operator to pass longer lengths of timber back to the start position. Supplied with floor stand, carrying handles, rubber feet, blade setting tool, 50mm diameter extraction outlet, 2.5m power cable and UK 3 pin plug.

The thicknessing height is quickly set using a large adjusting handle and reading from a scale marked in both metric and imperial measurements. The timber is fed through the cutting knives by two rubber coated drive rollers leaving a smooth unmarked finish. A cut of up to 3mm deep can be made, when more than 3mm needs to be removed, simply make multiple passes. When not in use both the infeed and outfeed tables fold up to make a more compact unit for convenient storage, there are also built-in carrying handles. A nice feature, is the addition of 2 chromed rollers on top of the machine which allow the operator to pass longer lengths of timber back to the start position. Supplied with floor stand, carrying handles, rubber feet, blade setting tool, 50mm diameter extraction outlet, 2.5m power cable and UK 3 pin plug.

A router table will convert a hand held plunging router into a stationary tool which is safer to use and quicker to set up than using freehand. Ideally suited for all 1/4″ sized routers (Those which use router bits with a ¼” diameter shank), this compact router table will perform a variety of jobs such as edge moulding, trenching and cutting tenons. The side frames are steel with a smooth melamine faced MDF table across the top. The insert plate, which must be drilled to suit your routers fixing points, is made from a tough plastic with an aperture in the centre for the cutter. The fence arrangement is simple and effective. The three clamps supplied as standard will hold the workpiece securely down against the table and up against the cutter leaving the operator to merely feed the timber through from right to left. A transparent guard protects the operator from flying chips and a dust chute is included for connecting to a vacuum or extractor. A sliding mitre fence, with a replaceable wooden face, completes the standard equipment. Suitable for use with router cutters up to 35mm diameter. The table can be used with any router which has a faceplate diameter of up to 190mm. This covers all 1/4″ shank routers and even some 1/2″ shank routers can be used. The height under the table is 260mm. If your router is taller than this, you will need to make 2 runners to go underneath the side legs to lift the table up, to accommodate the extra height. Supplied with tough plastic insert plate, adjustable fence with two replaceable wooden faces, horizontal feather board, two vertical clamps and sliding mitre fence.
