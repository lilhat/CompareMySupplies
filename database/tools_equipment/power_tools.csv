The thicknessing height is quickly set using a large adjusting handle and reading from a scale marked in both metric and imperial measurements. The timber is fed through the cutting knives by two rubber coated drive rollers leaving a smooth unmarked finish. A cut of up to 3mm deep can be made, when more than 3mm needs to be removed, simply make multiple passes. When not in use both the infeed and outfeed tables fold up to make a more compact unit for convenient storage, there are also built-in carrying handles. A nice feature, is the addition of 2 chromed rollers on top of the machine which allow the operator to pass longer lengths of timber back to the start position. Supplied with floor stand, carrying handles, rubber feet, blade setting tool, 50mm diameter extraction outlet, 2.5m power cable and UK 3 pin plug.
