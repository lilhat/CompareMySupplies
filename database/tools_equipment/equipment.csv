The automatic pressure cut-out switch provides user safety with a built-in safety valve and pressure regulator with twin gauges, giving the user-controlled variable air pressure.

This air compressor provides a fantastic combination of performance and durability ideal for professional applications in any workshop.

Note on compressor care: Pressure safety valves on Hyundai air compressors have been updated in compliance with the latest CE certification standards. The pressure release pull ring has been removed from the safety valve to prevent it from being misused to drain the air from the compressor tank, causing excessive wear to the valve.

Air and moisture should always be released daily using the drain valve located on the bottom of the tank.

Check the belt tension and condition weekly and ensure there are no air leaks from hoses and fittings, as this will greatly increase the electricity used to maintain constant air pressure.

This air compressor provides a fantastic combination of performance and durability ideal for professional applications in any workshop.

Calling all backyard warriors... it's time. Time to tackle that project you've been putting off for months (maybe even years). Whether it's re-building the crumbling garden wall or laying a patio for the BBQ, there's no need to get the builders in when you know you can do it yourself. All you need is the right tools for the job.

The T-Mech cement mixer is fully portable and mains powered, with a capacity of 70 litres it will help you tackle domestic repairs, residential renovations and part-time projects.

The edges of conventional tarps are usually sewn together and then cut to make room for metal eyelets. This weakens the material and as a result the tarpaulins can tear easily around the edges and eyelets. The edges of Yuzet tarpaulins on the other hand are folded over and then fusion welded which creates significantly stronger seams and a 100% waterproof fabric. The eyelets are ultrasonically welded, so there is no damage to the fabric and even under strain the material around the eyelets will not tear or break.
Yuzet tarpaulins offer UV protection for the entire lifespan of the product. UV filters and stabilisers are integrated into the material before the tarpaulins are produced. This means that the tarpaulins can be exposed to harsh weather conditions and still be UV- resistant in bright sunshine. Conventional tarpaulins usually have a UV resistant substance sprayed on after production which can easily ‘washed off’ in bad weather resulting in a short lifespan of the product.Guarantee - StatutoryWaterproofFeatures and benefitsSuperior to conventional tarpaulin and can be used for a wide range of applicationsYuzet tarpaulins are folded over and then fusion welded which creates significantly stronger seamsThe eyelets are ultrasonically welded, so there is no damage to the fabric100% waterproof fabric",BQ
