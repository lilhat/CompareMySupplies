24 Carat (24K) Gold Plating – 24 carat gold achieves excellent conductivity for great signal transfer. Banana plugs help prevent corrosion and deterioration of existing speaker wire. 
Connection – The banana plugs will connect from 3mm up to 7mm diameter speaker wire.
Dimensions – The overall length of the banana plug is 43mm and the pin is 13mm long. The pin is 4mm in diameter (as quoted in the title). This is the standard size used for most speakers’ world wide.
How to Use – Speaker cable can be connected easily through the side of the banana plug or through the top, using a screw mechanism. The plugs can be stacked with existing 4mm banana plugs.All the banana plugs are colour coded so you can attach the negative wire (black) to the black banana plug and the positive wire (red) to the red banana plug.
Why Buy?
If you are using speaker cable directly connected your speakers, you will not get the best performance from them as the copper speaker cable will oxidize and corrode over time. By using a banana plug you can prevent this from happening. They are extremely easy to install and not only do they improve the sound quality, they allow you to quickly plug and unplug speaker cable into the terminals. To attach the plugs to the speaker wire, the speaker wire should be stripped, inserted into the banana plug and the screw tightened until secure.
Most systems nowadays are jam-packed with cables running everywhere. It is usually very hard to properly insert speaker wire into terminals and to get them tight enough to hold the speaker wire in place. Also, if great care isn’t taken when inserting the speaker wire, stray copper strands that are noGuarantee - 1 year",BQ
